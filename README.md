# WaterDuckAndFallingSponges
This is a game Idea I had recently, I basically want to create a lake that keeps on shrinking as sponges fall from the sky. The player is a duck and can only survive in water, if he touches the foam or swims outside of the river, he dies. The aim is simple, get as far as you can. I am lokking for all kinds of talented people. Developers, 3D modelers and you can also join if you think you are very creative and can think of greate ideas. We are going to use unity for this project since it is the core enjine for most developers. Thank you.
